# Design-of-Motion-sickness-Prevention-Chair-Using-IMU-Sensor

The subject of our research is that we often hear and vibrate when we travel by means of transportation, and the shaking that happens is that the installed chair detects it.
The gyro sensor installed in the chair measures the value of the chair shaking. The sensor then measures the measurement and sensor program and enters it into the controller.
Subsequently, when the controller transmits data to move the motor installed in the chair according to the degree and slope of the chair, 
the three motors installed in the chair move in the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis directions respectively,
and the chair itself remains still even if the vehicle body shakes during the movement

However, the Z axis, or up and down, could not be adjusted through this project. This part will be improved later.
